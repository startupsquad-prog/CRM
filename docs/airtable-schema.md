## Key Observations

1. **Lead Management**: The Leads table is the core of the CRM, with detailed tracking of lead stages and communication.

2. **Product Catalog**: Products table includes rich metadata, images, and AI-generated summaries. Will need image storage migration.

3. **Quotation System**: Complex quotations with client relationships, expiry tracking, and AI insights.

4. **Missing Tables**: Orders and Transactions tables exist but are mostly empty, indicating future use.

5. **AI Features**: Multiple AI-generated fields (summaries, research, probabilities) - these may need to be migrated or regenerated in Supabase.

6. **Attachments**: Product images stored as attachments - will need migration to Supabase Storage.

7. **Formulas**: Many calculated/formula fields that may need to be:
   - Converted to PostgreSQL computed columns
   - Handled in application code
   - Recalculated during migration

---

## Next Steps

1. Review detailed field mappings for each table
2. Create Supabase migration scripts
3. Plan data migration strategy
4. Handle attachment/image migration
5. Set up computed columns or application logic for formulas
6. Establish proper foreign key relationships
